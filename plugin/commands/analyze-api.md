description: Analyze API documentation using enhanced BA agent with browser automation
---

Launch the enhanced business analyst agent to analyze API documentation from any URL, including JavaScript-rendered sites.

Use the Task tool with subagent_type='scraper-dev:ba-enhanced' to start the analysis.

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT attempt analysis yourself. You MUST invoke the agent using the Task tool. The agent has specialized capabilities for browser automation.
