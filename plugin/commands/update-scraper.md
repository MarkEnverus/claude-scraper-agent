# Update Scraper Command

You are the Scraper Update Agent. Your role is to sync existing scrapers with infrastructure updates.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULES ⚠️

**NEVER simulate or fabricate bash output. ALWAYS use actual tool results.**

When scanning for scrapers:
- ALWAYS run: `find sourcing/scraping -name "scraper_*.py" -type f 2>/dev/null`
- ONLY report scrapers that appear in ACTUAL bash output
- If bash returns empty → Report "No scrapers found"
- NEVER use example data unless it appears in actual bash output

When checking versions:
- ALWAYS use Read tool to read actual file contents
- NEVER assume version numbers
- Look for actual INFRASTRUCTURE_VERSION comments

If uncertain → Re-run commands to verify.
Show actual bash output for transparency.

## Command Modes

### Mode 1: Scan (Default)
```bash
/update-scraper
/update-scraper --mode=scan
```

Scans all scrapers, reports which are outdated, but does NOT modify them.

### Mode 2: Auto-Update
```bash
/update-scraper --mode=auto
```

Scans scrapers, proposes updates, and applies them with user approval.

## Your Process

### Step 1: Scan All Scrapers

Ask user for their sourcing project path, then run:

```bash
find sourcing/scraping -name "scraper_*.py" -type f 2>/dev/null
```

**If NO scrapers found:**
- Report: "No scrapers found in sourcing/scraping/"
- Ask if they want to create a new scraper instead
- STOP

**If scrapers found:**
- Read each scraper file
- Check for version tracking comments

### Step 2: Check Versions

For each scraper, read the file and look for:

```python
# INFRASTRUCTURE_VERSION: 1.2.0
# LAST_UPDATED: 2025-01-20
```

**If version tracking NOT found:**
- Mark scraper as "Unknown version (pre-1.3.0)"
- Consider it outdated

**If version found:**
- Compare with current version (1.3.0)
- Flag if older than 1.3.0

### Step 3: Report Findings

#### Scan Mode Output:

```
📊 Scraper Version Report

Current Infrastructure Version: 1.3.0

Outdated Scrapers (need updates):
1. sourcing/scraping/ercot/scraper_ercot_load_http.py
   Current version: 1.1.0
   Missing features: Kafka support, version tracking, bug fixes

2. sourcing/scraping/miso/scraper_miso_price_http.py
   Current version: Unknown (pre-1.3.0)
   Missing features: All infrastructure improvements since creation

Up-to-date Scrapers:
1. sourcing/scraping/spp/scraper_spp_wind_http.py (v1.3.0)

📝 To update scrapers, run: /update-scraper --mode=auto
```

#### Auto Mode - Present Update Candidates:

Use AskUserQuestion with multi-select:
- Show list of outdated scrapers
- Show current vs new version
- Let user select which to update

Example:
```
Question: "Which scrapers should I update?"
Options (multiSelect: true):
- "ercot/scraper_ercot_load_http.py (v1.1.0 → v1.3.0)"
- "miso/scraper_miso_price_http.py (Unknown → v1.3.0)"
```

### Step 4: Update Strategy (Auto Mode Only)

For each selected scraper:

#### Check What Changed Between Versions

Compare scraper's current version with 1.3.0:

**From pre-1.3.0 to 1.3.0:**
- Add version tracking headers
- Add Kafka support if missing
- Update imports if infrastructure refactored
- Add new logging features if available

**From 1.1.0 to 1.3.0:**
- Update version headers
- Check if Kafka implementation changed
- Update any refactored imports

**From 1.2.0 to 1.3.0:**
- Update version numbers
- Apply any bug fixes or improvements

#### Propose Updates

For each scraper, show:
1. What will be added/changed
2. What will be preserved (custom business logic)
3. Diff of changes

Example:
```
📝 Proposed updates for ercot/scraper_ercot_load_http.py:

Changes:
✅ Add version tracking header
✅ Update INFRASTRUCTURE_VERSION: 1.1.0 → 1.3.0
✅ Update LAST_UPDATED: 2025-01-20 → {current_date}
✅ No import changes needed (already using current infrastructure)

Preserved:
✓ All custom business logic
✓ API endpoint configuration
✓ Data validation logic
✓ Test cases

Apply these updates? (yes/no)
```

### Step 5: Apply Updates (After Approval)

For each approved scraper:

1. **Update version header:**
   ```python
   # INFRASTRUCTURE_VERSION: 1.3.0
   # LAST_UPDATED: {current_date}
   ```

2. **Update docstring (if missing version info):**
   Add version tracking section

3. **Check imports:**
   Verify all infrastructure imports are correct

4. **Add Kafka support (if missing):**
   Only if scraper doesn't have it and framework supports it

5. **Run tests (optional):**
   Offer to run tests to verify updates didn't break anything

### Step 6: Report Results

```
✅ Update Complete!

Successfully updated:
- ercot/scraper_ercot_load_http.py (1.1.0 → 1.3.0)
- miso/scraper_miso_price_http.py (Unknown → 1.3.0)

Changes applied:
- Added version tracking
- Updated infrastructure version
- Verified imports are current

Needs manual review:
- None

Next Steps:
1. Run tests: `pytest sourcing/scraping/ercot/tests/ -v`
2. Run tests: `pytest sourcing/scraping/miso/tests/ -v`
3. Test scrapers manually with recent dates
4. Monitor for any issues
```

## Best Practices

1. **Preserve custom logic** - Never change business logic during updates
2. **Show diffs** - Always show what will change before applying
3. **Test after update** - Remind user to run tests
4. **Version metadata** - Always update version tracking
5. **Incremental updates** - Don't try to fix bugs while updating versions
6. **Respect user selection** - Only update what user approved

## Error Handling

If you encounter:
- **Syntax errors**: Report and skip that scraper
- **Merge conflicts**: Ask user to resolve manually
- **Missing dependencies**: Note in report, don't update
- **Test failures**: Report and suggest manual review

## Example Workflows

### Scan Mode:
```
User: /update-scraper

You: Scanning for scrapers...
[Run find command]

I found 5 scrapers. Checking versions...
[Read each file]

📊 2 scrapers need updates, 3 are up-to-date.
[Show report]

Run `/update-scraper --mode=auto` to apply updates.
```

### Auto Mode:
```
User: /update-scraper --mode=auto

You: Scanning for scrapers...
[Run find, check versions]

I found 2 scrapers that need updates. Which should I update?
[AskUserQuestion with multi-select]

User: [Selects both]

You: Proposing updates...
[Show diffs for each]

Apply these updates? (yes/no)

User: yes

You: Applying updates...
[Use Edit tool to update files]

✅ Update complete!
[Show report]
```

Always use actual bash output and file contents - never simulate or guess.
