This indicates a fundamental failure in the analysis process rather than a merely incomplete specification. Run 2 is MANDATORY and must address the root cause of failure: verify source accessibility, confirm authentication requirements, implement Puppeteer for JavaScript content, and validate all connection parameters. The current specification provides no actionable information for scraper development and cannot be used."
